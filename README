_finance_ - a library for financial calculations in Ruby.

= INSTALL

  $ sudo gem install finance

= OVERVIEW

== GETTING STARTED

  >> require 'finance'

== AMORTIZATION

You are interested in borrowing $250,000 under a 30 year, fixed-rate
loan with a 4.25% APR.

  >> rate = Rate.new(0.0425, :apr, :duration => 30.years)
  >> amortization = 250000.amortize(rate)

Find the standard monthly payment:

  >> amortization.payment
  => DecNum('-1229.91')

Find the total cost of the loan:

  >> amortization.payments.sum
  => DecNum('-442766.55')

How much will you pay in interest?

  >> amortization.interest.sum
  => DecNum('192766.55')

How much interest in the first six months?

  >> amortization.interest[0,6].sum
  => DecNum('5294.62')

If your loan has an adjustable rate, no problem.  You can pass an
arbitrary number of rates, and they will be used in the amortization.
For example, we can look at an amortization of $250000, where the APR
starts at 4.25%, and increases by 1% every five years.

  >> values = %w{ 0.0425 0.0525 0.0625 0.0725 0.0825 0.0925 }
  >> rates = values.collect { |value| Rate.new( value, :apr, :duration = 5.years ) }
  >> arm = Amortization.new(250000, *rates)

Since we are looking at an ARM, there is no longer a single "payment" value.

  >> arm.payment
  => nil

But we can look at the different payments over time.

  >> arm.payments.uniq
  => [DecNum('-1229.85'), DecNum('-1360.41'), DecNum('-1475.65'), DecNum('-1571.07'), DecNum('-1641.34'), DecNum('-1680.27'), DecNum('-1680.32')]

The other methods previously discussed can be accessed in the same way:

  >> arm.interest.sum
  => DecNum('287515.45')
  >> arm.payments.sum
  => DecNum('-537515.45')

Last, but not least, you may pass a block when creating an Amortization
which returns a modified monthly payment.  For example, to increase your
payment by $150, do:

  >> rate = Rate.new(0.0425, :apr, :duration => 30.years)
  >> extra_payments = 250000.amortize(rate){ |period| period.payment - 150 }

Disregarding the block, we have used the same parameters as the first
example.  Notice the difference in the results:

  >> amortization.payments.sum
  => DecNum('-442745.98')
  >> extra_payments.payments.sum
  => DecNum('-400566.24')
  >> amortization.interest.sum
  => DecNum('192745.98')
  >> extra_payments.interest.sum
  => DecNum('150566.24')

*Note*: you are _not_ allowed to modify a payment to pay _less_ than the
normally calculated payment.

You can also increase your payment to a specific amount:

  >> extra_payments_2 = 250000.amortize(rate){ -1500 }

= ABOUT

I started developing _finance_ while analyzing mortgages as a personal
project.  Spreadsheets have convenient formulas for doing this type of
work, until you want to do something semi-complex (like ARMs or extra
payments), at which point you need to create your own amortization
table.  I thought I could create a better interface for this type of
work in Ruby, and since I couldn't find an existing resource for these
tools, I am hoping to save other folks some time by releasing what I
have as a gem.

More broadly, I believe there are many financial calculations that
are necessary for effective management of personal finances, but are
difficult (or impossible) to do with spreadsheets or other existing open
tools.  My hope is that the _finance_ library will grow to provide a set
of open, tested tools to fill this gap.

If you have used _finance_ and find it useful, I would enjoy hearing
about it!

= FEATURES

Currently implemented features include:

* Uses the {http://flt.rubyforge.org/ flt} library to ensure precision decimal arithmetic in all calculations.
* Fixed-rate mortgage amortization (30/360).
* Interest rates
* Various cash flow computations, such as NPV, IRR, and sum.
* Adjustable rate mortgage amortization.
* Payment modifications (i.e., how does paying an additional $75 per month affect the amortization?)
